Traditional maintenance strategies are reactive or schedule-based, often leading to unnecessary downtime and increased costs.  
This project introduces an **AI-powered Predictive Maintenance System** that continuously monitors machines and detects early signs of failure using multi-sensor data.

The system integrates **vibration, current, temperature, and acoustic signals** to assess machine health and generate timely alerts.
